#Tester (myrent-16-service-test)

This is the new model class:

```
package app.models;

import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Random;

import com.google.common.base.Objects;

public class Residence
{

  public Long id;
  public String geolocation;
  public Long date;
  public boolean rented;
  public String tenant;
  public double zoom;
  public String photo;


  public Residence()
  {
    date = new Date().getTime();
    geolocation = "";
    date = 0L;
    rented = false;
    zoom = 0;
    photo = "";
  }

  @Override
  public boolean equals(final Object obj)  {
    if (obj instanceof Residence)  {
      final Residence other = (Residence) obj;
      return Objects.equal(id, other.id) 
          && Objects.equal(geolocation, other.geolocation)
          && Objects.equal(date, other.date)
          && Objects.equal(rented, other.rented)
          && Objects.equal(tenant, other.tenant)
          && Objects.equal(zoom, other.zoom)
          && Objects.equal(photo, other.photo);
    }
    return false;
  }
}


```

Note the following:

- The id is declared but no longer explicitly initialized. Previously we generated a random long value and assigned it to the id.

- We still use the id field in the equals method when comparing two Residence objects. 
- This implies that it is necessary to obtain the id value from the server before the method is invoked

In ResidenceTest.setup we initialize the residence id values with values obtained from the server.

```

    /**
     * Set up for test.
     * Write (create) an array of residences on server.
     * Server echoes back each individual residence as it is created.
     * The server model generates the residence id.
     * Obtain this from the reflected back residence and apply 
     * to ResidenceTest.residences fields.
     * 
     * @throws Exception
     */
  @Before
  public void setup() throws Exception {

    for (int i = 0; i < NUMBER_RESIDENCES; i += 1) {
      Residence res = service.createResidence(residences[i]);
      residences[i].id = res.id;
    }
  }
```
