Deletion

Deletion of a subset of the residence list is facilitated by the introducion of a contextual actionbar. This is created by a long press on any of the list items intended for removal. The contextual action bar contains a menu icon (trashcan) which when clicked on completes the deletion process. A suitable Android interface is implemented to facilitate the various actions.
