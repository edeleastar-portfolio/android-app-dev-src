#Repository

Here we shall describe how you can break the association with GitHub that you established to download the baseline *donation-android-2016* and push your refactored application to a new repository that you will create on your Bitbucket account.


Access your Bitbucket account and create a repository named *donation-android-2016*

- If a similarly named repo already exists on your Bitbucket account then change its name to something like *donation-android-v1*:
	- This may easily be done by:
		- clicking on the repo to be renamed, 
		- clicking on the gear wheel located on the bottom left hand side, 
		- changing the name under Repository details | Name
		- Pressing the *Save repository details* button.

On the NUC cd into *donation-android-2016* and run the following commands in sequence.

```
git remote rm origin
```
This last command removes the association with GitHub.

Now bring your local repo up to date, associate it with the newly created repo on Bitbucket and push all:


```

git add .

git commit -m "Donation-02 lab complete"

```
Before running this next command it will be necessary to replace the placeholders <font color='red'>jdoe@wit.ie</font> and <font color='red'>jdoe</font> with the email you registered on Bitbucket and your login id:

```
git remote add origin https://jdoe@wit.org/jdoe/donation-android-2016.git <------- See Figure 2
```

Finally, push your repo to Bitbucket:
```

git push -u origin --all  

git push -u origin --tags  
```
You will be asked for your Bitbucket password.


Use the clone statement to complete the expression *git remote add origin* above. See Figure 2.

On your PC cd to where you locate your repos and run the SSH clone command. You have already have installed ssh on your pc during the summer school.

- This will pull the latest commit of donation-android-2016.
