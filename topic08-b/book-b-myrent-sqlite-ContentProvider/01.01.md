#Introduction

In this lab we continue from the end of MyRentSQLite, a cut-back version of the MyRent app we have been developing during the past several labs. We have provided an alternative to the file system for data storage in the form of an SQLite database. This added feature, however, is accessible only from within its containing app (MyRentSQLite). Here we shall refactor the app so that its data is accessible not only to the host application but also to other applications installed on the same device. 

The Android class ContentProvider constitutes the basic building block for this new feature.

We shall test the new feature in two ways. First we shall verify that if works correctly when exercised by MyRentSQLite. Then we shall develop a very simple Android test app to to read the MyRent database.


The code developed to the end of the previous lab (MyRentSQLite) is available to download: [MyRentSQLite](https://github.com/wit-ictskills-2016/myrent-sqlite.git)
