#MyRentApp

The entire loading process is initially triggered by the application object, which is the entry point for our application.

First introduce a field to hold the file name we will use to store the portfolio:

~~~
  private static final String FILENAME = "portfolio.json";
~~~

Then we replace the current portfolio creation with the following:

~~~
    PortfolioSerializer serializer = new PortfolioSerializer(this, FILENAME);
    portfolio = new Portfolio(serializer);
~~~

Add an import statement for PortfolioSerializer:

~~~
import org.wit.myrent.models.PortfolioSerializer;
~~~

Run the app now. See if you can create some Residences. Can you determine if they are being saved?

To do this, it may not be enough to just exit the app and launch again - as you will be merely restoring the already active app. See if you can actually 'kill' the application.

If you manage to do this, you might find that the data is not actually saved. We will fix this in the next step.


Here is the complete class for Reference Purposes:

~~~
package org.wit.myrent.app;

import static org.wit.android.helpers.LogHelpers.info;

import org.wit.myrent.models.Portfolio;
import org.wit.myrent.models.PortfolioSerializer;

import android.app.Application;

public class MyRentApp extends Application
{
  private static final String FILENAME = "portfolio.json";
  
  public Portfolio portfolio;

  @Override
  public void onCreate()
  {
    super.onCreate();
    PortfolioSerializer serializer = new PortfolioSerializer(this, FILENAME);
    portfolio = new Portfolio(serializer);

    info(this, "MyRent app launched");
  }
}
