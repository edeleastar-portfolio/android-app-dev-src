#Manifest

Since we shall be accessing a cloud service it is necessary to include a permission as follows:

```
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

```

We are using two services, BootReceiver and RefreshService. 


```
    <receiver android:name=".receivers.BootReceiver"
              android:exported="false">
      <intent-filter >
        <action android:name="org.wit.myrent.receivers.SEND_BROADCAST"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
```

```
    <service android:name=".services.RefreshService"
             android:exported="false"/>
```

In the cased of BootReceiver, the [Intent action](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#Intent(java.lang.String) is a bespoke one:

```
org.wit.myrent.receivers.SEND_BROADCAST
```
We have chosen this string to be unique within the system - the choice of action name components such as SEND_BROADCAST is arbitrary.

If you wish that the automatic refresh process is initiated on booting the device (emulator, phone or tablet) then you should add or replace the above intent filter with the following:

```

<intent-filter >
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
</intent-filter>

```

Whether you simply add or add and replace is a programmatic decision.

- Should you decide to replace, then there are implications elsewhere in the code where you may have used org.wit.myrent.receivers.SEND_BROADCAST.
