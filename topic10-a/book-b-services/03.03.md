#ResidenceListFragment

Here we shall introduce code to 

- accept the intent broadcast by RefreshService,
- update the displayed list of residences.

The following import statements are required:

```
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.support.v4.content.LocalBroadcastManager;
import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
```

Add a string to uniquely identify ResidenceListFragment as the target of the RefreshService sendBroadcast:

```
  public static final String BROADCAST_ACTION = "org.wit.myrent.activities.ResidenceListFragment";

```

Declare an IntentFilter field and initialize it in a private convenience method `registerBroadcastReceiver` which we invoke in `onCreate`:


```

  private IntentFilter intentFilter;

```

```
  private void registerBroadcastReceiver()
  {
    intentFilter = new IntentFilter(BROADCAST_ACTION);
    ResponseReceiver responseReceiver = new ResponseReceiver();
    // Registers the ResponseReceiver and its intent filters
    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getActivity()).registerReceiver(responseReceiver, intentFilter);
  }


```

```
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  ...

  registerBroadcastReceiver();

```

Declare and initialize a residence list field in the ResidenceAdapter class:

```

  class ResidenceAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<Residence>
  {
    ...
    List<Residence> residences;

    public ResidenceAdapter(Context context, ArrayList<Residence> residences) {
      ...
      this.residences = residences;
    }

    ...
  }
```

Create an inner class `ResponseReceiver`, a subclass of BroadcastReceiver whose purpose here is to receive updates triggered within RefreshService. Each RefreshService broadcast results in invoking ResponseReceiver.onReceive, the sole purpose of which is to obtain the lastest list of residences and notify the adapter that the data set has changed. This results in refreshing the rendered list.

```
public class ResidenceListFragment ... {
  ...
  ...
  //Broadcast receiver for receiving status updates from the IntentService
  private class ResponseReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver
  {
    //private void ResponseReceiver() {}
    // Called when the BroadcastReceiver gets an Intent it's registered to receive
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)
    {
      //refreshDonationList();
      adapter.residences = app.portfolio.residences;
      adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
    }
  }
}
```
