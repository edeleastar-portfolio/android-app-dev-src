#Start services


In MyRentApp we broadcast an intent directed to the BroadcastReceiver.

We also rebroadcast the intent if a user changes the refresh frequency in the settings.

Add this line of code to the end of MyRentApp.onCreate: 

```
    sendBroadcast(new Intent("org.wit.myrent.receivers.SEND_BROADCAST"));

```

In SettingsFragment.onSharedPreferenceChanged add this code:

```
    // If the refresh frequency is changed send a broadcast so that alarm appropriately reset.
    String refreshIntervalKey = getActivity().getResources().getString(R.string.refresh_interval_preference_key);
    if(key.equals(refreshIntervalKey)) {
      getActivity().sendBroadcast(new Intent("org.wit.myrent.receivers.SEND_BROADCAST"));
    }

```

These code changes necessitate an import statement:

```
import android.content.Intent;

```

Test as follows:

- Set the refresh frequency at the minimum 1 minute on two devices, A & B.
- On device A create a series of residences on the cloud server.
- Observe the residence list on device B: it should sync after a minute or so.
- Change the number of residences on the cloud using device A.
- Change the refresh frequency in the settings in device B to 2 minutes. At the end of this period its residence list should sync to the cloud.
