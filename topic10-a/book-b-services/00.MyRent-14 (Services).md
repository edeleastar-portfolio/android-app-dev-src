#Services

We avail of two Android classes, BroadcastReceiver and IntentService, to asynchronously refresh local data obtained by querying a cloud-based service. The BroadcastReceiver receives intents sent by a Context method, `sendBroadcast`. The IntentService handles asynchronous requests. Our approach is to initialize an alarm in the BroadcastReceiver to exercise the IntentService at interverals configurable from the settings. When the alarm fires, the local data is asynchronously refreshed.
