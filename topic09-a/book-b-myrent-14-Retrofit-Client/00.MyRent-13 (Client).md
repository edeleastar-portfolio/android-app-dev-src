#Introduction

In a previous lab we introduced an SQLite database. This allows us to retain a local copy of the data. Here we integrate the Retrofit REST client to facilitate manipulation of server-based data. The local and remote data are kept in sync. Testing is performed against localhost and Heroku deployed databases.
