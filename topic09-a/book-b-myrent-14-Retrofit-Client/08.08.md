#Delete

<h4>ResidenceListFragment</h4>

We have already in place a method to delete a selection of residences:

![Figure 1: MultiChoiceModeListener method and helper to delete residence objects](img/06.png)

We shall now add functionality to delete residences across the network.

We have already implemented the Callback interface by refactoring the class header. This implementation has been applied to updating a Residence object. Consequently it is necessary to adopt a slightly different approach to delete a residence. We shall create an inner class named DeleteRemoteResidence and implement the Callback interface on this class. Its methods will then be used to handle to response from the delete network call.

Invoke a method named `deleteResidence` within the private helper method `deleteResidence` which then becomes:

```
  private void deleteResidence(ActionMode actionMode) {
    for (int i = adapter.getCount() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (listView.isItemChecked(i)) {
        Residence residence = adapter.getItem(i);
        portfolio.deleteResidence(residence);
        deleteResidence(residence.id);
      }
    }
    actionMode.finish();
    adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
  }

```

Implement the new `deleteResidence` method:

```
  public void deleteResidence(String id) {
    DeleteRemoteResidence delResidence = new DeleteRemoteResidence();
    Call<String> call = app.residenceService.deleteResidence(id);
    call.enqueue(delResidence);
  }

```

DeleteRemoteResidence is an inner class we define here and that implements the Callback interface:


```
class DeleteRemoteResidence implements Callback<String> {
  
}
```

This necessitates implementing the interface's methods:

```
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Response<String> response, Retrofit retrofit) {
      
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable t) {

    }
```
