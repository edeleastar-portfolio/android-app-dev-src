#Refresh

<h4>ResidenceListFragment</h4>

The final feature we shall implement is the ability to refresh the local data store with the content of the server-side database. This wil be achieved by engaging the menu item (represented by the rotate icon) that we partially implemented earlier in the lab. We shall complete development of this feature now. And in a later lab we shall demonstrate how the process may be automated using a timer or a service.

The approach is similar to that employed for deletion:

- Complete the implementation of `retrieveResidences`.
- Develop an inner class, `RetrieveResidences`, that implements the Callback interface and its methods.

Here is the code:


```
  public void retrieveResidences() {
    RetrieveResidences retrieveResidences = new RetrieveResidences();
    Call<List<Residence>> call = app.residenceService.getResidences();
    call.enqueue(retrieveResidences);
  }

```


```
  class RetrieveResidences implements Callback<List<Residence>>
  {
    @Override
    public void onResponse(Response<List<Residence>> response, Retrofit retrofit) {
      List<Residence> listRes = response.body();
      Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Retrieved " + listRes.size() + " residences", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
      portfolio.refreshResidences(listRes);
      ((ResidenceAdapter) getListAdapter()).notifyDataSetChanged();
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
      Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Failed to retrieve residence list", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
  }

```

This code will not compile because the Portfolio method invoked in `onResponse` does not exist. Here it is:

```
  /**
   * Clear local and sqlite residences and refresh with incoming list.
   * @param residences List residence objects
   */
  public void refreshResidences(List<Residence> residences)
  {
    dbHelper.deleteResidences();
    this.residences.clear();

    dbHelper.addResidences(residences);

    for (int i = 0; i < residences.size(); i += 1) {
      this.residences.add(residences.get(i));
    }
  }

```

Test as follows:

1. Create a series of residences.
2. Use Postman to view the residences on the server database.
3. Use Postman to delete a subset of the residences.
4. Refresh the residence list on the MyRent app. The resulting number of list items (residences) should correspond to that displayed in Postman.
