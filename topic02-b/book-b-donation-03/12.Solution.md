If you have been checking in this lab as you go along, you may wish to save your work to github or bitbucket at this stage.

The simplest way of doing this is to first 'uncouple' the project from its current repo:

~~~
git remote rm origin
~~~

Note that this does not eliminate the commit history - it is all preserved intact locally in the `.git` folder. Now create a repo on one of the above services.

Once it is created, we associate this remote 'origin' with our local repo:

~~~
git remote add origin !!https url of repo!!
~~~

And finally, we can push the repo:

~~~
git push -u origin --all  
~~~

Tags should be pushed separately:

```
git push --tags
```

You will be asked for your password for the remote service before the push will be executed.
