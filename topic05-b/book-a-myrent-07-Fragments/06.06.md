#Test

Build and install the app on a phsical device or emulator:

- Create a new residence
- Explore the various features.
- No difference in the behaviour of the app will be obvious as a consequence of introducing fragments.
- The need for and use of fragments will be demonstrated later in the course.

The application at the end of this lab is available for reference here: [myrent-07](https://github.com/wit-ictskills-2016/myrent-07.git)
