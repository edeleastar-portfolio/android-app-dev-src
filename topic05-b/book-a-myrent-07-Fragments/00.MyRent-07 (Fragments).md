#Fragments

An Activity may comprise one or more fragments, each of which represents a portion of a user interface. Multiple fragments can be combined in a single actiity to build a multi-pane screen. In this lab our purpose in introducing fragments is to later facilitat the inclusion of a horizontal swipe feature to the ResidenceActivity class.
