#Fragments

 In the previous lab we gained experience in using single-pane screens, a pane containing only a single fragment. Here we develop a simple application to demonstate how two fragments may be successively rendered on a single pane in portrait mode. We provide the same feature in landscape mode but additionaly allow the simultaneous rendering of an additional fragment. This is sometimes referred to as the master-detail pattern.
