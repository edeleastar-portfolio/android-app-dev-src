#Settings

Settings allow a user to modify application features and behaviour. In this lab we demonstrate the use of settings to input a username, password pair, the size of the list of residences to download from the cloud and the frequency at which this list is automatically refreshed by a service or services. Services will be the subject of a future lab.
