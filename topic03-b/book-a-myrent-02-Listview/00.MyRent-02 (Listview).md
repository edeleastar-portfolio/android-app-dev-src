#ListView

Our current version of MyRent (V01) only permits a single Residence to be entered. In this lab we seek to manage a list of residences. To do this we need to extend the model by including a new class - 'Portfolio' - to manage all our residences. We will also need a new Activity - ResidenceListActivity - to display the full portfolio of residences.
