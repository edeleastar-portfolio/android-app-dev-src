#Callback (Standalone method)

This approach is for the purpose of instruction only and is unlikely to be used very much in practice.

- Create a project in Eclipse named *callbacks*.
- Within the project create a package *org.wit.callback*.
- We shall populate this package with the following files:
    - Callback.java
    - EventLoop.java
    - TextView.java
    - TextWatcher.java
![](img/03.png)

Here is the TextWatcher code:

Filename: TextWatcher.java

```
package org.wit.callback;

public interface TextWatcher
{
  void onTextChanged(String changedtext);
}
```
As you can see, TextWatcher is a simple interface with one method.

- Both the interface name and its method have been chosen to correspond to names in the ResidenceActivity code (see Figure 1 in previous step).

Next, create a class that implements TextWatcher:

Filename: Callback.java

```
package org.wit.callback;

public class Callback implements TextWatcher
{
    @Override
    public void onTextChanged(String changedtext)
    {
      System.out.println(changedtext);
    } 
}

```
This class does nothing other than implement the TextWatcher method *onTextChanged*

- Compare again with the code in ResidenceActivity.

The next class we develop is TextView:

Filename: TextView.java

```

package org.wit.callback;

public class TextView
{
  private TextWatcher textwatcher;
  private boolean somethingHappened;

  public void addTextChangedListener(TextWatcher textwatcher)
  {
    // Save the event object for later use.
    this.textwatcher = textwatcher;
    // Nothing to report yet.
    somethingHappened = false;
  }
  
  // Invoking with flag == true sets scene for a callback
  public void setPredicate(boolean flag)
  {
    somethingHappened = flag;
  }
  
  // This method will be invoked repeatedly in an event loop
  public void doWork()
  {
    // Check the predicate, which is set elsewhere.
    if (somethingHappened)
    {
      // Signal the event by invoking the interface's method.
      textwatcher.onTextChanged("Finally - you called back");
      somethingHappened = false;
    }
  }
}
```
Here is a brief analysis of TextView:

- It contains a reference named *textwatcher* to an object whose class implements *TextWatcher* interface.
- A boolean *somethingHappened*, when possessing the value *true*, indicates that an event has occurred.
- The method *addChangedListener*:
    - Takes as a parameter a reference to an object whose class implements the TextWatcher interface
    - Sets *somethingHapped* to *false* indicating that an event has yet to occur.
- The public method *setPredicate* exists to change the state of *somethingHappened*, thus indicating an event has occurred.
- The method *doWork*:
    - Does nothing if *somethingHappened* is *false*
    - Invokes *onTextChanged* on *textWatcher* if *somethingHappened* is *true*.
        - This is the *callback*: *textWatcher* is a reference to an object that was passed in as an argument in *addTextChangedListener*. We shall see where this invocation occurred in the next and final class in the project.

Filename: EventLoop.java

```
package org.wit.callback;

// Class to simulate a short-lived event loop
public class EventLoop
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    TextWatcher textwatcher = new Callback();
    TextView textview = new TextView();
    textview.addTextChangedListener(textwatcher);

    int val = 0;
    // The simulated event loop
    do
    {
      if (val % 100 == 0)
      {
        textview.setPredicate(true); // the trigger to fire an event
      }
      // invoke repeatedly but trigger event only when predicate true
      textview.doWork();
      val += 1;
    } while (val < 500);// we expect 5 events to be triggered
  }
}
```

This class simulates an event loop. 

- It models a situation where the system is waiting for text input to an edit widget (control).
- When text is entered an event is triggered and the interface method *onTextChanged* invoked.

In more detail:

- We instantiate a Callback object and assign it to a variable *textwatcher* of interface type TextWatcher
- Next we instantiate TextView and invoke *addTextChangedListener* on the object created passing *textwatcher* as a parameter
- We then set up the event loop and at specific times set the predicate to *true* which causes an event to be triggered.

Run the application and observe the output:
