# Functional interface

A functional interface is an interface that has just one abstract method, not including methods of the parent Java Object class, default methods or static methods.

Here are four examples of functional interfaces, followed by an example of a non-functional interfaces.

```
interface Runnable {
    void run();
}
```

```
interface StringCompare {
  int compare(String o1, String o2);
}

```

This next interface is also functional because the method `equals` is a method of the parent Object class and so the interface is considered to possess only 1 abstract method - `compare`.

```
interface AnotherStringCompare {
   boolean equals(Object obj);
  int compare(String o1, String o2);
}
```
Here is the TextWatcher interface we have been working with in the earlier steps in this lab. It has only one abstract method, `afterTextChanged`, and so qualifies as a functional interface.

```
import java.util.Date;

public interface TextWatcher {
  
  // const declaration
  int id = 1;
  
  // static method
  static long beforeTextChanged() {
    return new Date().getTime();
  }
  
  // abstract method
  void afterTextChanged();
  
  // default method
  default void onTextChanged() {
    System.out.println("I hate change");
  }
}

```

The [Android TextWatcher interface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextWatcher.html) is an example of a non-functional interface because it has three abstract methods.

```
public interface TextWatcher {

  void afterTextChanged(Editable s);
  void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int count, int after);
  void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count);

}

```
 
Java language enthusiasts and budding language lawyers may be interested in the  complete formal definition which is available [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.8).
