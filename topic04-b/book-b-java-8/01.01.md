#Introduction Java 8

The new features introduced to the Java Language are described in the official documentation [What's New in JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html).

We shall examine the use of lambda expressions as a means of replacing certain anonymous classes. This includes a look at the changes to the [Java interface type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/interfaceDef.html) where constant declarations and default and static methods are now permitted, in addition to existing abstract method declarations. We shall also explain what is meant by functional interfaces and explore what exactly is meant by an anonymous class. A simple Java application is progressively developed as part of the lab.
