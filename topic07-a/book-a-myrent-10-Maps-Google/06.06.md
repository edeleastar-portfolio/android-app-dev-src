#Model

Before we introduce the map code we shall modify the Residence model class allowing it to store the current zoom level of the map.

- The purpose is to ensure that the zoom level is retained as one switches between the list and detail views.

Here are the code snippets to be added to Residence.java:

```
    //New fields
    public double  zoom       ;//zoom level of accompanying map
    private static final String JSON_ZOOM           = "zoom"          ; //map zoom level
     
```
Constructors:

```
  public Residence()
  {
    ...
    zoom        = 16.0f;
    
  }
  
  public Residence(JSONObject json) throws JSONException
  {
    ...
    zoom          = json.getDouble(JSON_ZOOM);
  }
```
toJSON method

```
  public JSONObject toJSON() throws JSONException
  {
    ...
    json.put(JSON_ZOOM          , zoom);
    
    return json;
  }
```
