#Embedded Map & Orientation

In a previous lab our MyRent app consumed a GoogleMap API. Here we provide an alternative mapping system provided by MapBox. This is based on the open source OpenStreetMap project. This approach has the advantage of providing greater flexibility, not requiring keys and, importantly, resulting in a significantly smaller release build.
