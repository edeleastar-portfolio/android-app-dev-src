#Siging your app and basic cryptography

Cryptography supports the millions of daily secure internet transactions, for example, in the use of HTTPS, SSH, secure email, secure messaging and eCommerce. <br>

Widespread use of cryptography is made in the Android ecosystem, for example a hash function produces a fingerprint of the app and public-key cryptography is used to generate and use a set of public-private keys in signing and verifying the app. <br>

Specifically, in this lab, we shall sign our MyRent app and explore some simple uses of supporting cyptographic techniques.
