App Signing (Crypto)

We conclude our discussion on app signing with a very brief examination of the underlying mathematics used in basic cryptographic functions such as symmetric key and public key cryptography. Simple examples are provided to demonstrate Diffie-Hellman key exchange and RSA (public key cryptography).
