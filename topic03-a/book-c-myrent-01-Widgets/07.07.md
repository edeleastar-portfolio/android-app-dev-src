#Summary

Here is what we have achieved in this topic:

- Explored various ways of modifying layout working with the Graphical Layout editor, the XML editor and the Outline view.
- Added widgets to the layout
    - Section labels and dividers
    - A button to display the date the property was registered
    - A checkbox to indicate whether or not the residence is rented.

- Added a listener in the controller to detected changes in the UI checkbox state and transmit any state changes to the model Residence object

- Added a date field to the model and intialized this at the time a residence object created which represents the registration date of the property with the MyRent app.

- Described how to conduct a simple test using the debugger to verify that the listeners operate correctly and that UI data transmission takes place successfully in both directions between model and UI.

The application at the end of this lab is available for reference here:
