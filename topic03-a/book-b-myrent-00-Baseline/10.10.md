#Summary

Here is what we have done in this topic:

- Created a model class, Residence.
    - We will progressively extend this class as we develop MyRent.
    - At the end of this topic, Residence includes:
        - An id that will have a unique value for each instance of Residence.
        - A String containing a geolocation in the form of *latitude,longitude*.
            - For example: "52.45678,-7.54321"
            - Five places of decimals provides accuracy not less than about +/- 1 metre.
        - Getter and setter methods for geolocation.

- Created a layout in xml
    - Introduced an EditText input control to accept and display geolocation coordinates

- Added a listener to the Activity class to capture any changes in input (the geolocation) and transmit these changes to the Residence object for storage.

The application at the end of this lab is available for reference here:
