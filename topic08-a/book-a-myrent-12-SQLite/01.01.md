#Introduction

In the previous SQLite lab we worked with a subset of MyRent. Here we integrate an SQLite database into the full MyRent app, replacing the existing file storage system. Resume development from the end of the cameral module.

We shall remove all references to the PortfolioSerializer, replacing it with appropriate SQLite related code. The Portfolio class will still be retained and the local in-memory storage of residence objects preserved also.
