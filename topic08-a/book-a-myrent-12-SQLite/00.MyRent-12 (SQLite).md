#SQLite

In the MyRent series of labs we have used file storage as a means of data persistence. In an earlier lab we introduced an SQLite database to an app based on a subset of MyRent.Here we replace the file system in MyRent with an SQLite database. Later we shall open up this database to other applications using Android's ContentProvider.
